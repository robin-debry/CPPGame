## The Project

This project consists of creating a game of our choice as a team.

We have to develop this game in C++.

But we have no restrictions regarding the game, the
game rules and the game design.

We prefer a 2D game, because it's easier to make and quicker to develop.

*Expectation :*

- Language Used C++ - SFML
- Simple playable game
- 2D game
- No design and rule restrictions

## Our Game

### Overview

Our team decided to take inspiration from the game [JetPack Joyride](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpack_Joyride). A 2D game in which the player embodies a character who must avoid coming into contact with lazers and missiles that appear at random. The player must also collect as many green bills as possible to accumulate the most money possible.

### Our features

For our game, we decided to use the same rules as the JetPack Joyride game, which consists of pressing a key to move up and then releasing the key to move down, thus dodging missiles and lazers.

The player takes on the role of a thief pursued by police officers, and must not touch the lazers, otherwise the game is over.

In addition, he must collect as many greenbacks as possible to escape with as much money as possible.

*Features* :

- Move up and down
- Collect banknotes
- Don't touch the lazers (otherwise game over)
- Endless game

## How to Play

You need just the space bar to play the game and the escape key to pause the game.
